# Plugin Creating #

This repository is a note to all RainbowFreedomDev members. If you are going to create a plugin for RainbowFreedom, you must:

1) The main file should be under "com.RainbowFreedomDev.(plugin name).Main"

2) You must contact [FoxIshDaBest] (https://github.com/FoxIshDaBest) and tell him what the plugin does, why you think it should be added to RainbowFreedom, and who will develop it.

3) You must have a lot of experience with developing plugins. We do not want bad quality code.

4) _Your plugin ***MUST*** be tested!_ This means you have to test it before uploading it to the RainbowFreedomDev organization.

After you make your plugin (*that meets all of the requirements*), send Fox an email at foxishdabest@gmail.com
